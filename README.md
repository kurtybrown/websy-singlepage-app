# Basic Express Server
This repository can be used as a template to configure a basic NodeJS web server using Express JS.
To use it,
1. Create a new repository specifying the basic-exress-server template option.
2. Clone the repository onto your machine.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the solution.

The Web Server is configured to run on port 4000 - [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

When modifying the code, only change the files in the `src` directory. Changes made here will be built automatically and copied into the `/public` directory.
If you make a change to the `index.js` file, you will need to kill the node process (Ctrl + c) and re-run the `npm start` command.
